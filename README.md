# cs166project DQN vs Double DQN on Atari
Author: Isac Lopez

Course: CS166 — Reinforcement Learning

Environment: ALE/Pong-v5 (Gymnasium)

Frameworks: PyTorch, Gymnasium, Google Colab

This project implements and compares two reinforcement learning algorithms—Deep Q-Network (DQN) and Double DQN—on the Atari Pong environment. Using convolutional neural networks, experience replay, and target networks, the agent learns directly from stacked grayscale pixel frames. Double DQN is included as the required algorithmic variant to reduce Q-value overestimation and improve training stability.

All experiments were conducted in Google Colab, and training behavior was visualized using learning curves and gameplay videos.
